# Dungeon Crawler
This project demonstrates mastery of Java and JavaFX and industry-level architectures to build a full-stack game. This project was developed as a final project for a class.

## About the Game
- You are the hero, and your task is to navigate the board and collect the treasures to score the highest points possible
- You move 1 spot at a time, using the controls provided on screen, WASD, or the arrow keys.
- There is a teleporter on the map that can send you to any open spot on the grid.
  - By default, enemies cannot use the portals, but you can choose to enable this feature.
- Each time the exit is taken, you move to the next level. The difficulty increases with each level.
  - Starting with a base of 2, 1 enemy is added for every level completed
